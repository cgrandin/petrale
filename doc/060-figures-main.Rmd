<!-- Biomass and recruitment -------------------------------------------------->

(ref:fig-base-sb-en) Spawning biomass of `r sp` for the base model with $B_{MSY}$ reference points. The solid black line with points show the medians of the posteriors, the shaded ribbon encapsulated by dashed lines covers the 95% CI for the posteriors, the point at $B_0$ is the median estimate for the unfished biomass, and the vertical line over that point is the 95% CI for that parameter. The upper part of the CI is not shown for reasons of clarity for the trajectory, the median and CI for $B_0$ here is `r paste0(base_sbo[1], ", ", base_sbo[2])` thousand t. The $B_{MSY}$ reference point lines are shown here for reference only, they are not advised for use in decision making for this stock. See section \@ref(scam-ref-points) for more details.

<!-- Relative spawning biomass ----------------------------------------------->

(ref:fig-base-depletion-en) Relative spawning biomass for the base model. The shaded area represents the 95% CI. Horizontal lines indicate the 0.2 $B_0$ (solid, red) and 0.4 $B_0$ (dashed, green) reference points. Because the ribbon represents relative spawning biomass (depletion) and the reference points are with respect to $B_0$, all uncertainty about the ratio of the spawning biomass to the reference points is captured in the ribbon and the reference points are shown as point values.
